this is a java spring service it will simulate 7 bank APIs services to fetch data. you need to create 7 endpoints to serve the data.
in the APIs folder there are the 7 endpoints each with swagger and output sample. create 7 RestController classes each for the endpoint relevant. 
i do this seperation intentionally. it will fetch the data from the json that was created. the data fetching will be in the service layer not directly in the restcontroller.
